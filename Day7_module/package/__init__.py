# It’s still recommended to include __init__.py when:

# You want the folder to behave like a regular package (e.g., for relative imports).

# You want to add initialization code (e.g., logging setup, version info).

# Your project might be run in older Python environments (pre-3.3).

# You’re packaging your code (e.g., for PyPI or shared libraries).
